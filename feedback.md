# What went well

- When asked about solution complexity, he understood what it was and where the non-linear complexities were.
- He had good ideas about and around scalability and asynchrony
- There were no unit tests, but when asked about unit testing, he had a good explanation for why they could be useful.


# Suggestions on places to focus for the future would be
- Dive into developing REST web services in more detail - understand how the different HTTP verbs can map to actions in the app. Get some deeper understanding on how to create URLs that map to objects in the system, like including a user id as a URL parameter to differentiate different users and the data they own.
- Unit testing! Unit testing is a basic requirement for professional software engineering now. Learn a testing framework, and how to write good unit tests. Get some experience in writing tests that prove your given requirements, prove that errors are caught, and cover all of the branch points in your units.
- Treat a take home submission as your way to put your absolute best foot forward.
- Make sure you don't have extraneous files in a submission that may be left over from previous design attempts (that's what source control can do for you). 
- Make sure you validate input, especially when data is coming from outside your control (users will do all kinds of unexpected things like use words where numbers are expected, etc)
- Watch for bugs that might creep in - this is where unit testing is very helpful.
